### 1. String Manipulation


- **Slicing**: Extracting parts of strings using indices to get substrings.
- **Concatenation**: Combining strings using the `+` operator to form new strings.
- **Common Methods**: Methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.split()`, `.replace()`, and others are used to transform and analyze string data.

### 2. Functions


- **Definition**: Functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters.
- **Parameters and Arguments**: Functions can take parameters to work with different inputs and return results using the `return` statement.
- **Scope**: Variables within a function have local scope, meaning they are not accessible outside the function.

### 3. Tuples


- **Immutability**: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, making them useful for read-only collections of items.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Similar to lists, tuples can be indexed and sliced to access specific elements or sub-tuples.
- **Usage**: Tuples are often used to return multiple values from functions and to store heterogeneous data.

### 4. Dictionaries


- **Key-Value Pairs**: Each item in a dictionary is a pair consisting of a key and a value, allowing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Mutable**: Dictionaries can be modified by adding, changing, or removing key-value pairs.
- **Methods**: Common methods include `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`, `.get()`, and `.update()` for working with dictionary data.

### 5. Sets

- **Uniqueness**: Sets automatically ensure that all elements are unique, making them useful for eliminating duplicates.
- **Set Operations**: Sets support operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference for combining and comparing sets.
- **Mutable**: Elements can be added or removed from sets using methods like `.add()`, `.remove()`, and `.discard()`.
